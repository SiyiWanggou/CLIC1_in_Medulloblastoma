## Introduction
The code listed below is associated with the paper from Xi Huang's lab, 
"Chloride intracellular channel 1 cooperates with potassium channel to promote medulloblastoma growth".
This manuscript majorly focus on the role of CLIC1 in tumorgenesis of medulloblastoma.
In this repository, we provide the code for CLIC1 correlated ion channel genes detection and RNAseq analysis for DAOY and ONS76 cell lines.
